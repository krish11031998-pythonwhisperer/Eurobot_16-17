# Eurobot 2016-17

Developed a Autonomous obstacle avoidance robot that had a collection-grabbing mechanism that could collect hollow cylinders and transport them from one place to another.

Along with the obstacle avoidance, the robot also had a movement correction control system  i.e system used for correcting the robot if, and when , the movement of  the robot accidentally overshoots and therefore travelling more than the prescribed path.

The eurobot had the following hardware components in the control system:
* Ultrasonic sensor: for obstacle avoidance
* Servos : for the collection-grabbing mechanism 
* MD25 : Motor controller
* Motors
